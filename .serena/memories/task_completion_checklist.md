# Task Completion Checklist

## Before Committing Code
1. **Lint Check**: Run `pnpm lint` and fix all errors
2. **Type Check**: Ensure TypeScript compiles without errors
3. **Build Test**: Run `pnpm build` to verify production build works
4. **Environment Validation**: Run `pnpm run validate-env` for production changes

## Code Quality Verification
```bash
# Check for linting errors
pnpm lint

# Verify TypeScript compilation
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit

# Test production build
pnpm build

# Validate environment setup
pnpm run validate-env
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Contact form submits successfully
- [ ] Navigation between all routes works
- [ ] Deep links work (e.g., `/project/financial-automation`)

## Security Verification
- [ ] No sensitive data in environment files committed to git
- [ ] `.env` files are properly gitignored
- [ ] EmailJS domain restrictions are configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is functioning
- [ ] Honeypot and bot detection are active

## Git Workflow

# Before committing
pnpm lint
pnpm build
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
git push
```
