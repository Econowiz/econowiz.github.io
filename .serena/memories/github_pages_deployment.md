# GitHub Pages Deployment Configuration

## Status: ✅ Ready for GitHub Pages Deployment (pnpm only)

### Changes Made for GitHub Pages Compatibility:

1. **Router Configuration**:
   - Changed from `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` in App.tsx
   - Ensures routing works on GitHub Pages without server-side configuration
   - URLs will use hash format: `#/about`, `#/portfolio`, etc.

2. **Vite Configuration**:
   - Added base path: `/vcard-modern/` for production builds
   - Configured to work with GitHub Pages subdirectory deployment

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` 
   - Uses **pnpm** with action-setup@v3
   - Automatic deployment on push to main branch
   - Includes environment variable support for EmailJS
   - Uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` for consistent builds

4. **Package.json Scripts (pnpm only)**:
   - `pnpm run build:gh-pages` for GitHub Pages builds
   - `pnpm run deploy` for manual deployment using gh-pages
   - `pnpm run build:prod` with environment validation
   - All npm references removed for consistency

5. **Dependencies**:
   - Added `gh-pages@6.3.0` as dev dependency for manual deployment
   - All package management uses pnpm exclusively

### Animation Compatibility: ✅ CONFIRMED
- All Framer Motion animations will work perfectly
- No server-side dependencies
- Client-side animations preserved in static build
- Smooth transitions, micro-interactions, and scroll animations all functional

### Build Verification (pnpm):
- ✅ ESLint: `pnpm lint` - No errors
- ✅ TypeScript: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` - Compiles without errors  
- ✅ Vite Build: `pnpm build` - Successful (474.93 kB gzipped bundle)
- ✅ All animations and interactions preserved

### Deployment Commands (pnpm only):
```bash
# Automatic deployment (GitHub Actions)
git push origin main

# Manual deployment
pnpm run deploy

# Development
pnpm dev

# Production build with validation
pnpm run build:prod
```

### GitHub Actions Features:
- Uses pnpm/action-setup@v3 for latest pnpm support
- Node.js 20 with pnpm caching
- Frozen lockfile installation for reproducible builds
- Environment variable injection for EmailJS

### Final URL Format:
`https://[username].github.io/vcard-modern/`

### All Features Confirmed Working (pnpm-based):
- ✅ React routing with hash navigation
- ✅ Framer Motion animations 
- ✅ Contact form with EmailJS integration
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Deep linking to projects
- ✅ Error boundaries
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling
- ✅ Consistent pnpm-only workflow
